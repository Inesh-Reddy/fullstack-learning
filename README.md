## Upto week - 7 learning checkpoint

- Project 1: A Simple Blog (Beginner Level)

        Create a simple blog where users can read posts.
        Use JavaScript for the logic, DOM manipulation for the user interface, and LocalStorage for storing the posts.
        Each post should have a title, content, and author.
        Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete posts.


- Project 2: Note Taking App (Intermediate Level)

        Create a note-taking app where users can create, read, update, and delete notes.
        Use Express for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and React for the frontend.
        Implement user authentication using JWT.
        Each note should have a title and content.
        Users should be able to search for notes by title.


- Project: Hostel Booking Website (Advanced Level)

        Step 1: Planning
            - Identify the key features that your website needs.
                - User registration and login.
                - Hostel listing.
                - Room booking.
                - Payment processing.

        Step 2: Backend - Express and MongoDB
            - Create an Express server and connect it to a MongoDB database.
            - DB Schema : Users, Hostels, Rooms, and Bookings.

        Step 3: User Registration and Authentication
            - Implement user registration and login using JWT for authentication.
            - Ensure passwords are hashed before they are stored in the database.

        Step 4: Hostel Listing
            - Create routes for adding and retrieving hostel listings.
            - Each hostel listing should include information like name, location,   price, and available rooms.

        Step 5: Room Booking
            - Implement a booking system where users can book available rooms.
            - Ensure that once a room is booked, it is not available for others to book.

        Step 6: Payment Processing
            - Integrate a payment gateway like Stripe for processing payments.
            - Ensure that bookings are only confirmed once payment is successful.

        Step 7: Frontend - React
            - Create the frontend of your application using React.
            - Use Recoil for state management and React Router for routing.

        Step 8: Connecting Frontend and Backend
            - Connect your React frontend to your Express backend.
            - Ensure that data can be passed between the frontend and backend correctly.
